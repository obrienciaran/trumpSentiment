# trumpSentiment
A sentiment analysis of President Trump's tweets. 

Exploratory data analysis is performed on President Trump's tweets, incorporating the Twint tool.

Twint is an advanced Twitter scraping & OSINT tool written in Python that doesn't use Twitter's API, allowing you to scrape a user's followers, following, Tweets and more while evading most API limitations.  More information below. 

Use scapeTweets.py to collect the latest 500 Tweets from Trump, clean them, and save them down in a .csv format. Simple change the output path.
